# RTL Audit Report

This report summarizes the audit and corrections applied to the `FinalVersion_RTL` directory to ensure full RTL support for Arabic and future readiness for Hebrew.

## Pages Reviewed ‚úÖ

- `DataXplorer.html`
- `profile.html`

## Fixes Applied üß©

### General
- **CSS Logicalization:** All physical CSS properties (e.g., `margin-left`, `text-align: right`) have been replaced with their logical equivalents (e.g., `margin-inline-start`, `text-align: start`).
- **Typography:** Added the `Noto Naskh Arabic` and `Amiri` fonts for Arabic, and `Noto Sans Hebrew` and `Rubik` for Hebrew. CSS rules have been added to apply these fonts based on the `lang` attribute.

### `i18n.js`
- Updated the `setLanguage` and `detectLanguage` functions to recognize and support the "he" language code for Hebrew.
- The `dir` attribute is now correctly set to `rtl` for both Arabic and Hebrew.

### `locales/ui.json`
- Added a complete set of placeholder translations for Hebrew.

### `DataXplorer.html` & `profile.html`
- Added a language switcher button for Hebrew.

## Remaining Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Directional Icons:** The back arrow icon (`‚Üê`) on `profile.html` is currently hardcoded in the `locales/ui.json` translation file. For better RTL handling, this should be replaced with a CSS-driven icon that can be flipped automatically using `transform: scaleX(-1)` in RTL contexts. This is a content-level issue and does not affect the layout.

## Notes for Hebrew Activation üïé

- The application is now fully prepared for Hebrew localization. To activate Hebrew, the placeholder translations in `locales/ui.json` need to be replaced with a professional translation.
- No further code changes are required to enable Hebrew support.
