## Fixes Applied üß©

### General
- **CSS Logicalization:** All physical CSS properties (e.g., `margin-left`, `text-align: right`) have been replaced with their logical equivalents (e.g., `margin-inline-start`, `text-align: start`).
- **Typography:** Added the `Noto Naskh Arabic` and `Amiri` fonts for Arabic, and `Noto Sans Hebrew` and `Rubik` for Hebrew. CSS rules have been added to apply these fonts based on the `lang` attribute.

### `i18n.js`
- Updated the `setLanguage` and `detectLanguage` functions to recognize and support the "he" language code for Hebrew.
- The `dir` attribute is now correctly set to `rtl` for both Arabic and Hebrew.

### `locales/ui.json`
- Added a complete set of placeholder translations for Hebrew.

### `DataXplorer.html` & `profile.html`
- Added a language switcher button for Hebrew.
- **Back-to-Map Link:** Implemented a "Back to map" link on `profile.html` with a CSS-driven icon (`‚Üê`) that automatically flips for RTL languages.

## Notes for Hebrew Activation üïé

- The application is now fully prepared for Hebrew localization. To activate Hebrew, the placeholder translations in `locales/ui.json` need to be replaced with a professional translation.
- No further code changes are required to enable Hebrew support.
